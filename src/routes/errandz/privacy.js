<h2>Retention period and procedures</h2>
<p className='text-black'>For all Records obtained, used and stored by Errandz, we will conduct periodic reviews of the Records retained, confirming their purpose, continued validity, accuracy and requirement to retain such Records. Records will be kept for as long as they are needed to meet the operational or contractual needs of Errandz, together with legal and regulatory requirements. Errandz may transfer paper-based Records to an alternative media format in instances of long retention periods. As a general principle, Errandz will only need to retain one copy of the final version of a Record. Draft documents may be destroyed immediately unless they contain vital information which were not otherwise contained the final document. 
The retention periods for Records provided under this Policy takes into consideration: the requirements of Errandz for such Records; the type, sensitivity and importance of such Record; contractual obligations; the purpose of processing such record; lawful basis for processing the records; the requirements of the law. Where it is not possible to define a statutory or legal retention period in line with the applicable data protection/privacy laws, we will identify the criteria by which the period can be determined (such as industry standards) and update this Policy as may be necessary. 
</p>
<h2>Destruction of Records</h2>
<p className='text-black'>Destruction of Records is a critical component of a data retention policy. Once the retention period has elapsed, the Records are either reviewed, archived, returned, anonymized or confidentially destroyed depending on their purpose, importance and legal requirements. When a Record has reached its designated destruction date, the DCO shall refer to the retention register to determine the next action to be taken. Not all data or records are expected to be deleted upon expiration; sometimes it is sufficient to anonymise the data, return the Record or to archive Records for a further period.</p>
<p className='text-black'>Records will not be kept after the retention period unless:</p>

<ul className='text-black'>

<li>the Record is the subject of a pending litigation, administrative or regulatory proceedings. In these circumstances, destruction will be delayed until such regulatory proceedings have been completed, at which time a new retention period will be created. 
</li>
<li>the Record has long-term value for Errandz’s statutory or regulatory obligations. 
</li>
<li>Cabek Errandz determines that such Record will be permanently stored, provided that no legal, regulatory or contractual breach will occur by the permanent retention of such record. 
</li>
<li>there is a legal or regulatory reason or order to maintain the Records either permanently or for a longer period. 
</li></ul>
<p className='text-black'>Cabek Errandz is committed to the secure and safe disposal of any Record in accordance with our contractual and legal obligations. Accordingly, when the Records have been retained until the end of their retention period, they can be destroyed in the following ways:</p>
   
<ul className='text-black'>

<li>Hardcopy of documents will be destroyed by shredding or burning. 
</li>
<li>Non-sensitive information can be thrown in a normal trash bin and properly disposed. 
</li>
<li>Electronic Records will be deleted /erased and cleared from recycle bins. 
</li>
<li>Electronic equipment or systems containing Records will be destroyed. Where a specific Record is stored in one single media such as a CD Rom and cannot be erased, such media used to store the Record will be physically destroyed. 
</li>
<li>Destruction of electronic Records should render them non-recoverable even using forensic data recovery techniques. 
</li>
  </ul>
